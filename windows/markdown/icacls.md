# `icacls` Command

`icacls` is a command-line utility in Windows used to modify and display access control lists (ACLs) on files and directories. It helps manage permissions and inheritance, providing a more flexible way than older tools like `cacls`.

## Usage Examples

### Grant Full Control to a User

```shell
icacls "C:\example\file.txt" /grant John:F
```

### Deny Write Access to a User

```shell
icacls "C:\example\file.txt" /deny John:W
```

### Remove a User from ACL

```shell
icacls "C:\example\file.txt" /remove John
```

### Change Ownership

```shell
icacls "C:\example\file.txt" /setowner Administrator
```

### Apply Changes Recursively

```shell
icacls "C:\example" /grant John:(OI)(CI)F /t
```

### Backup ACLs

```shell
icacls "C:\example" /save acl_backup.txt /t
```

### Restore ACLs

```shell
icacls "C:\example" /restore acl_backup.txt
```
