## Usage Examples

### Install SDK Quietly with Specific Features

Install the Windows SDK with minimal UI, specifying certain features (e.g., compilers and debuggers):

```bash
winsdksetup.exe /Quiet /Features +Compiler,+Debuggers
```

### Install SDK Without Web Components

Install the SDK without downloading any additional web content:

```bash
winsdksetup.exe /NoWeb
```

### Custom Installation Path

Install the SDK to a specific directory:

```bash
winsdksetup.exe /InstallPath "C:\CustomSDKPath"
```

### Generating Installation Log

Create a log file during installation for troubleshooting:

```bash
winsdksetup.exe /Log "C:\InstallLogs\sdk_install.log"
```

### Uninstall SDK

Remove the SDK from the system:

```bash
winsdksetup.exe /Uninstall
```
