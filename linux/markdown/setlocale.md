## Usage Examples

### Setting Locale in a C Program

Here's how you might use `setlocale` in a C program:

```c
#include <locale.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
    printf("Locale set to: %s\n", setlocale(LC_ALL, NULL));
    return 0;
}
```

### Checking Current Locale in Bash

To view your current locale settings:

```bash
locale
```

### Changing Locale for a Session

To temporarily change the locale for a session:

```bash
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```

## Cheat Sheet

```plaintext
# Set locale to system default in a C program
#include <locale.h>
setlocale(LC_ALL, "");

# Display current locale settings
locale

# Temporarily change locale for a session
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```

Note: `setlocale` is primarily a function in C; usage in the terminal is more related to setting environment variables.
