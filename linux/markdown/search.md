# `search` Command in Linux

The `search` command is not a standard command in Linux. However, itâ€™s often confused with `find`, `grep`, or `locate`, which are used for searching files and text within files. Below is an explanation of the `find` command, which is commonly used for searching files and directories.

## Description

The `find` command is used to search for files and directories in a file system based on various criteria such as name, type, size, and permissions. It recursively searches through directories and performs specified actions on matched items.

## Common Options

| Option               | Description                                       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `-name <pattern>`    | Search for files matching the name pattern.       |
| `-type <type>`       | Specify the file type (`f` for file, `d` for directory). |
| `-exec <command>`    | Execute a command on each matched file.           |
| `-size <n>`          | Search for files of a specific size.              |
| `-mtime <n>`         | Search for files modified `n` days ago.           |
| `-user <username>`   | Search for files owned by a specific user.        |
| `-perm <mode>`       | Search for files with specific permissions.       |

## Usage Examples

### Find Directories by Name

find <path> -type <type>                   # Specify file type (f, d)
find <path> -size <+/-n>                   # Search by file size
find <path> -mtime <n>                     # Search by modification time
find <path> -exec <command> {} \;          # Execute command on results
